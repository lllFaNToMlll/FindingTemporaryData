# FindingTemporaryData
A program for finding and changing temporary data in the text.
The program is fed the text, after which it is preprocessed. 
The user is then asked to enter a date relative to which the found temporary data will be converted. 
At the end, the program outputs a dataframe of the data found and changed.
The search for temporary data was performed using recurrent expressions.
